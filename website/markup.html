            <p class='p l'>
                My name is Joseph Yu. I am an undergraduate senior from Santa Clara University, who is majoring in computer science and engineering and aiming for a Bachelor's degree. I have plenty of experience in Python, Java, and many other programming languages. I have been coding since I was five, and have some interest in other disciplines like philosophy and political science. I am generally creative, accountable, and always brimming with new ideals. I am incredibly good at recognizing connections quickly and passing down concepts through graphs and analogies. I am a responsible and dependable contributor to projects, especially in conjunction with a team effort, and am excellent at acting as a mediator in times of conflict. I am willing to work overtime and will always attempt to exceed the common standards of the workplace, no matter what those might be.
